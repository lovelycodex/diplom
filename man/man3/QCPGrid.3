.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Responsible for drawing the grid of a \fBQCPAxis\fP\&. 

This class is tightly bound to \fBQCPAxis\fP\&. Every axis owns a grid instance and uses it to draw the grid lines, sub grid lines and zero-line\&. You can interact with the grid of an axis via \fBQCPAxis::grid\fP\&. Normally, you don't need to create an instance of \fBQCPGrid\fP yourself\&.
.PP
The axis and grid drawing was split into two classes to allow them to be placed on different layers (both \fBQCPAxis\fP and \fBQCPGrid\fP inherit from \fBQCPLayerable\fP)\&. Thus it is possible to have the grid in the background and the axes in the foreground, and any plottables/items in between\&. This described situation is the default setup, see the \fBQCPLayer\fP documentation\&. 
.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "QCPGrid::QCPGrid (\fBQCPAxis\fP * parentAxis)"
Creates a \fBQCPGrid\fP instance and sets default values\&.
.PP
You shouldn't instantiate grids on their own, since every \fBQCPAxis\fP brings its own \fBQCPGrid\fP\&. 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void QCPGrid::setAntialiasedSubGrid (bool enabled)"
Sets whether sub grid lines are drawn antialiased\&. 
.SS "void QCPGrid::setAntialiasedZeroLine (bool enabled)"
Sets whether zero lines are drawn antialiased\&. 
.SS "void QCPGrid::setPen (const QPen & pen)"
Sets the pen with which (major) grid lines are drawn\&. 
.SS "void QCPGrid::setSubGridPen (const QPen & pen)"
Sets the pen with which sub grid lines are drawn\&. 
.SS "void QCPGrid::setSubGridVisible (bool visible)"
Sets whether grid lines at sub tick marks are drawn\&.

.SS "void QCPGrid::setZeroLinePen (const QPen & pen)"
Sets the pen with which zero lines are drawn\&.
.PP
Zero lines are lines at value coordinate 0 which may be drawn with a different pen than other grid lines\&. To disable zero lines and just draw normal grid lines at zero, set \fIpen\fP to Qt::NoPen\&.
