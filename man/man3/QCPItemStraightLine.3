.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A straight line that spans infinitely in both directions\&. 

Straight line example\&. Blue dotted circles are anchors, solid blue discs are positions\&. It has two positions, \fIpoint1\fP and \fIpoint2\fP, which define the straight line\&. 
.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "QCPItemStraightLine::QCPItemStraightLine (\fBQCustomPlot\fP * parentPlot)"
Creates a straight line item and sets default values\&.
.PP
The constructed item can be added to the plot with \fBQCustomPlot::addItem\fP\&.

.PP 
.SS "double QCPItemStraightLine::selectTest (const QPointF & pos, bool onlySelectable, QVariant * details = \fC0\fP) const\fC [virtual]\fP"
This function is used to decide whether a click hits a layerable object or not\&.
.PP
\fIpos\fP is a point in pixel coordinates on the \fBQCustomPlot\fP surface\&. This function returns the shortest pixel distance of this point to the object\&. If the object is either invisible or the distance couldn't be determined, -1\&.0 is returned\&. Further, if \fIonlySelectable\fP is true and the object is not selectable, -1\&.0 is returned, too\&.
.PP
If the object is represented not by single lines but by an area like a \fBQCPItemText\fP or the bars of a \fBQCPBars\fP plottable, a click inside the area should also be considered a hit\&. In these cases this function thus returns a constant value greater zero but still below the parent plot's selection tolerance\&. (typically the selectionTolerance multiplied by 0\&.99)\&.
.PP
Providing a constant value for area objects allows selecting line objects even when they are obscured by such area objects, by clicking close to the lines (i\&.e\&. closer than 0\&.99*selectionTolerance)\&.
.PP
The actual setting of the selection state is not done by this function\&. This is handled by the parent \fBQCustomPlot\fP when the mouseReleaseEvent occurs, and the finally selected object is notified via the selectEvent/deselectEvent methods\&.
.PP
\fIdetails\fP is an optional output parameter\&. Every layerable subclass may place any information in \fIdetails\fP\&. This information will be passed to \fBselectEvent\fP when the parent \fBQCustomPlot\fP decides on the basis of this selectTest call, that the object was successfully selected\&. The subsequent call to \fBselectEvent\fP will carry the \fIdetails\fP\&. This is useful for multi-part objects (like \fBQCPAxis\fP)\&. This way, a possibly complex calculation to decide which part was clicked is only done once in \fBselectTest\fP\&. The result (i\&.e\&. the actually clicked part) can then be placed in \fIdetails\fP\&. So in the subsequent \fBselectEvent\fP, the decision which part was selected doesn't have to be done a second time for a single selection operation\&.
.PP
You may pass 0 as \fIdetails\fP to indicate that you are not interested in those selection details\&.
